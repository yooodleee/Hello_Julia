"""JuliaFEM.jl - an open source solver both industrial and academia usage

The JuliaFEM software libray is a framework that allows for the distributed
processing of large Finite Element Models across clusters of computers using
simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to 
thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. The basic
design principle is: everything is nonlinear. All physics models are nonlinear
from which the linearization are made as a special cases.

# Examples

Typical workflow to use JuliaFEM to solve a partial differential equations,
is 1) read mesh, 2) create elements, 3) update element properties, 4) create 
problems, 5) create analysis, and 6) run analysis. A simple linear static
analysis of elastic block is clarifying these steps.

```julia 
using JuliaFEM
```

1. Usually the first thing to do is to create a geometry of domain.
    Typically this is done by reading a mesh file from disk. Currently
    supports reading a mesh from Code file format (using `aster_read_mesh`)
    and from ABAQUS file format (using `abaqus_read_mesh`).

```julia
mesh = aster_read_mesh("mesh.med")
```

2. Next step is to create one or several sets of elements from a mesh.
    This is done using a function `create_elements(mesh, set_name)`.

```julia
body_elements = create_elements(mesh, "body")
traction_elements = create_elements(mesh, "traction")
bc_elements = create_elements(mesh, "bc")
```

3. In JuliaFEM, all properties of elements are given using so called fields.
    Fields can depend from time or spatial coordinates elements. In special 
    cases field is constant in time, spatial or both directions. Updating 
    fields to element is done using `update!`-function.

```Julia
update!(body_elements, "youngs modulus", 120.0e3)
update!(body_elements, "poissons ratio", 0.3)
update!(body_elements, "surface pressure", 100.0)
update!(body_elements, "displacement 1", 0.0)
update!(body_elements, "displacement 2", 0.0)
update!(body_elements, "displacement 3", 0.0)
```

4. The physics considered to be solve is given using `Problem`. Problem type 
    can be e.g. `Elasticity` for hyperelasticity, `Heat` for solving the heat 
    equation and so on. Problems are defined by giving the problem type as first 
    argument, problem name in second argument and the last argument is giving the
    dimension of problem, meaning degrees of freedom connected to each node. After
    problems are created, elements are added to them by using function `add_elements!`.

```julia 
body = Problem(Elasticity, "body", 3)
traction = Problem(Elasticity, "traction", 3)
bc = Problem(Dirichlet, "bc", 3, "displacement")
add_elements!(body, body_elements)
add_elements!(traction, traction_elements)
add_elements!(bc, bc_elements)
```

5. After geometry and physics is defined, you next define what kind of analysis
    are you going to perform. Anaysis can be, for example, quasistatic analysis,
    analysis of dynamics of system, natural frequency analysis and so on. Some 
    other special analysis type also exsits, like performing model dimension 
    reduction by creating super-elements or running optimization loop, given 
    geometry, another analysis and initial conditions. For simplicity, you now 
    create a linear quasistatic analysis of given problems. Problems are added 
    to analysis using `add_problems!`.

```julia 
analysis = Analysis(Linear)
add_problems!(analysis, body, traction, bc)
```

6. The last thing to do is to request the results of analysis to be written to 
    disk for linear use and actually perform the analysis. Currently, Xdmf output
    is supported, which can then be read using ParaView.

```julia 
Xdmf_output = Xdmf("analysis_results")
add_results_writer!(analysis, xdmf_output)
run!(analysis)
close(xdmf)
```

After analysis is ready, types and variables can be accessed using REPL or 
Jupyter notebook for further postprocessing. Simulation can also be written
int a function to be part of a larger analysis process. For more information
